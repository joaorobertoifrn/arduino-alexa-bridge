# Arduino to Alexa Bridge Library

This library provides a set of interfaces / models for Alexa-compabible messages generation. It might be useful if you want to force Alexa detecting your Arduino devices or continuously reporting their states.

## Installation

As **arduino-alexa-bridge** is not yet published to official registry, you have to download it manually. Just copy corresponding sources into **./lib/arduino-alexa-bridge** (assuming you're using PlatformIO) or **Arduino/libraries/arduino-alexa-bridge** (in case of Arduino usage) folder.

## Usage

Check [examples](https://github.com/sskorol/arduino-alexa-bridge/tree/master/examples) for details.
